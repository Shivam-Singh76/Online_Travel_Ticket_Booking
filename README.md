## Overview
This is a prototype implementation of an **Online Travel Ticket Booking System** built in Java.  
It allows users to:
- Register and login
- Search buses and trains
- Book and cancel tickets
- Process and refund payments (simulated)

## Features
- **BookingService**: Handles bus/train search, booking, cancellation, and ticket management.
- **UserService**: Manages user registration, login, and user data.
- **PaymentService**: Simulates payment and refund operations.
- **Models**: `Bus`, `Train`, `Ticket`, `User` represent vehicles, tickets, and users.
- **Main class**: Provides a console-based menu for interacting with the system.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open in IntelliJ IDEA.
3. Run `Main.java` to start the console application.
4. Use the menu to register, login, search, book, and cancel tickets.

## Prototype Stage
- Backend functionality is implemented.
- Frontend/UI is not included in this prototype.
- Database integration (MySQL) and real payment gateway are future enhancements.

## Future Work
- Add frontend (HTML/CSS/JS).
- Integrate with MySQL database.
- Implement real payment gateway.
